## Introduction

[ActiveJ](https://activej.io) is a fully-featured alternative Java platform built from the ground up as a replacement of Spring, 
Spark, Quarkus, Micronauts, and other solutions. It is minimalistic, boilerplate-free, and incomparably faster, which is proven by benchmarks.
ActiveJ has very few third-party dependencies, yet features a full stack of technologies with an efficient async programming model and a powerful 
DI library [ActiveInject](https://inject.activej.io)

## Quick start

Insert this snippet to your terminal...

```
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=io.activej -DarchetypeArtifactId=archetype-http -DarchetypeVersion=3.0
```

... and open the project in your favourite IDE. Then, build the application and run it. Open your browser on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) 
to see the "Hello World" message. 

#### Fully-featured embedded web application server with Dependency Injection:
```java
public final class HttpHelloWorldExample extends HttpServerLauncher { 
    @Provides
    AsyncServlet servlet() { 
        return request -> HttpResponse.ok200().withPlainText("Hello, World!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Launcher launcher = new HttpHelloWorldExample();
        launcher.launch(args); 
    }
}
```
Some technical details regarding the above example:
- *Features a JAR file size of only 1.4 MB. In comparison, a minimal Spring web app size is approximately 17 MB*.
- *The cold start time is 0.65 sec.*
- *The [ActiveInject](https://inject.activej.io) DI library which is used, is 5.5 times faster than Guice and hundreds of times faster than Spring.*
